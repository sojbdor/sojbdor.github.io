Non structure non-structure is a group with the purpose of sharing music that resonates with the revelation of 'this must be unearthed.' The melodies themselves partake in self-destructive every week, echoing the ephemeral nature of existence. Adherence to the link. Music, the eternal philosopher, whispers to me, inviting you to vibe with us on this mind-bending journey. Dance to your own beat and dive into this expedition whenever the cosmic signal aligns with your vibe. Your soundscapes, discoveries, uniqueness, cosmic insights, unearthed treasures, and the cosmic wisdom you stumble upon resonate deeply with those of us who groove to the rhythm of existence. Remember, your presence isn't a transaction; it's an interstellar jam session of links shared consciousness in the cosmic now<br>
Picture this: an individual who has weathered an immensely challenging day returns home to solitude, yearning for connection. Upon receiving a carefully chosen piece of music, a ray of solace and purpose illuminates their otherwise bleak day. If the notion of exploring and sharing resonates with you. I encourage you to join in.<br><br>

<big><b>Non structure, 2023</big></b><br><br> 
Non-structure is an avant-garde concept. It embodies an ever-evolving ecosystem of ideas, a dynamic space where creativity thrives in its unfiltered form. It's an exploration of the raw act of creation in the present moment. It's the liberation from excessive planning, devoid of the constraints of entertainment or predefined shapes. Beneath these words lies a collection of drawings that have transcended their original forms. They have transformed into a new expression, painting a canvas with nuanced shades of darkness, greys, white, and multi-colors. These visual are like the illustration of selected texts of figures across various spectrums - politicians, philosophers, feminists, and radical thinkers<br><br>
In 2024 Non Structure became also a sublabel of independent ambient label based in France. It will show the importance of art through designs, texts, photographies and books<br><br>

"A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. The international women's movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion. Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs - creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted."<br><br>
Text by Donna Haraway <em>A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century</em><br><br>

"You are either conscious of the types of values  institutions you are aligned with or you willingly look the other way. It is our individual responsibility to be fully engaged and hyper-aware when it comes to the institutions, promoters, parties, labels..."<br><br>
