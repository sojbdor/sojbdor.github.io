<big><b>Dark Triggers</b></big><br><br>
They met at Gaswerk for a residency of 1 week, in October 2021. They both started in sound design on modular systems. The "Dark Triggers" EP has been created through 3 big jam sessions where the main patterns were found. During live sessions Sukkube works with a eurorack system and her VCOs are most of the time used without a sequencer and envelopes which results in a huge layer of metallic noises without boundaries, while also utilising a TR-09 for the main rhythm. Sage-S set is full eurorack and he has a powerful sequencer to design an accurate sound and groovy patterns<br><br>

<big><b>The River Of Neïd</b></big><br><br>
Neïd is a city built on ancient ruins. Situated from miles and miles underground, the river of Neïd flows around the tower of the rabbit master to throw itself into the black sea of the North West of the city. The ambient temperature of the river diffuses a petroleum jelly textile on its surface that enchants everyone who touches it. The river of Neïd has organisms living in it, it was nourished by the melody of sulfur particles caused by the hydraulic action of the liquid on the rocks<br><br>
