This project talks about a dying culture by capitalist and speculative art and right-wing extremists, big firms, big compagnies in an unusual and sincere way. It invites us to think, feel and act in order to free ourselves from the grip of the current art/music trends that we ourselves have discussed on the social networks, who play at giving us obligations, orders, digital models, formats to follow to be accepted in the game of « too much pretty and sexy ». The Form Of Techno is a reflection based on this new society of the order, where the individual is no longer master of himself of what he want to do, but intimately subject to the performance of "to much pretty and sexy".

<em>The Pull Of The Chaos</em>, 2020, acrylic on canvas, 70 x 110 cm

The Form of techno started during the first lockdown. It is focuses on current trends in contemporary art, this sort of art who is «out of context», taking codes of perfections, obligations, orders and digital models like the ways to make art and deadly to be accepted in the game. It is massive, aggressive violent with contrasts between colors, written with techno in mind. It shows the importance of the auditory aspect has repercussions on the painted gestures. It is a kind of real-time auditory experimentation, which adapts its design, colors and movements to the changes induced by sounds.

It is a reflection based on this new society of the order, where the individual is no longer master of himself of what he want to do, but 
intimately subject to the performance of «to be pretty and sexy». After a few years dealing with the institutional conventions of contemporary art rules and their contradictions, Charlene felt the need to break away from them rules, to create a new language that expresses itself freely, who is more natural, dark and real. 
<br><br><br>
The approach is to reflects light on techno music and our new society. It depicts scenes from digital heritage in a metaphoric way, mixing cerebral landscapes, organic forms, dirty textures, sensual colored patterns with black and dripping outlines. Resembling body infections, 3D sculptures, atoms or anatomical limbs. This project is a metaphor on a personnal regard on this society, like a truly expression of what she feel, it’s like an allegory of progressive art.
