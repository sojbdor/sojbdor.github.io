If we talk about techno we must first talk about the birth of electronic music who born in 1950 with the first technical tools which creates sounds, with synthetic sound and signal generators and recorded with magnetic tape. From these years comes the first radio stations in Europe. 

Pierre Schaeffer created the very first pieces of electronic music and concrete music. 30 years after, Kraftwerk, a group in Germany Dusseldorf become a the most important actor of creating new style of electronic music, like Krautrock, synth pop.  Techno was born symbolically in 1985 with the creation by Atkins of the independent label Metroplex, followed by Transmat (1986) and KMS (1987). Born in 1988, in Chicago first the Acid House music, the very first label appears, first creation of vinyl and them record shops in UK. The term "TECHNO" born in Detroit, one years after acid house in 89, it’s derived from the word "technology » like the technology of the futur, it’s a kind of electronic music, the difference with electronic, was that It’s a music who make the people dance characterized by sound more darker and sometimes atmospheric.

In 2020, after a lot a parties, we observe that there is like a battle between the artists with the monopole of the line up/internet and those, small producers pushing their performances to the maximum to attract the 'visibility' they lack to become a respectable musician. 

This goes against the values of our current society in 2020 with the crisis of Corona Virus the clubs, the music, the techno suffers, the Dj's have no more places where to perform, they sell their production equipment to pay their rent. Some DJs tries to stream their performances, but everyone knows that if you are not famous you won't make money, if you don’t have a good label and a lot of followers on your Instagram you don’t exist, but it is that techno? It is that music? 

This project talks about a dying culture by capitalist and speculative art, firms in an unusual and sincere way. It invites us to think, feel and act in order to free ourselves from the grip of the current art/music trends that we ourselves have discussed on the social networks, who play at giving us obligations, orders, digital models, formats to follow in order to be accepted in the game of « too much pretty and sexy ».

The Form Of The Techno is the reflection of a new society of the order, where the individual is no longer master of himself of what he want to do, but intimately subject to the performance of "to be pretty and sexy". 

After a few years dealing with the institutional conventions of contemporary art rules and their contradictions, Charlene felt the need to break away from them rules in order to create a new language that expresses itself freely, who is more natural, more truly dark and real.

The intention is to reflect something different that also separates from a schema of an utopian narrative story for example "Freheit Und Freiheit" where the paintings invited us to enter a naive world, with prudish colors. This new project is a call for the destruction of our digital heritage, our society that kills people by corrupt them by giving them rules, codes and obligations.

The Form of The Techno reflect light on techno music and our new society of the « too much and pretty ». It depicts scenes from digital heritage in a metaphoric way mixing cerebral landscapes and organic forms, sensual colored patterns with black and dripping outlines. 

Resembling body infections, 3D sculptures, atoms or anatomical limbs. This project focuses on current trends in contemporary art and those codes of perfection, whose obligations, orders and digital models have become essential and deadly to be accepted in the game.

It is massive, aggressive with black contrasts, written with techno in mind. The importance of the auditory aspect has repercussions on the painted gestures. It is a kind of real-time auditory experimentation, which adapts its design, colors and movements to the changes induced by sounds.<br><br><br><br>
