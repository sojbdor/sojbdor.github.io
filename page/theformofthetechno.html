If we talk about techno we must first talk about the birth of electronic music before in 1950 and the first technical tools which creates sounds, with synthetic sound and signal generators recorded  with magnetic tape. From these years comes the first radio stations in Europe. Pierre Schaeffer created the very first pieces of electronic music. Later the term "techno" is derived from the word "technology », it’s a kind of electronic music. Techno was born symbolically in 1985 with the creation by Atkins of the independent label Metroplex, followed by Transmat (1986) and KMS (1987). 

Today she observes that there is a battle between the artists with the monopole of the line up and the internet and those, the small producers pushing their performance to the maximum to attract the 'visibility' they lack to become a respectable musician. 

After a few years dealing with the institutional conventions of contemporary art rules and their contradictions, Charlene felt the need to break away from them in order to create a new language that expresses itself freely. 

This goes against the values of our current society in 2020 with the crisis of Corona Virus the clubs, the music, the techno suffers, the Dj's have no more places where to perform, they sell their production equipment to pay their rent. Some DJs tries to stream their performances, but everyone knows that if you are not famous you won't make money.

This project talks about a dying culture by capitalist and speculative art, firms in an unusual and sincere way. It invites us to think, feel and act in order to free ourselves from the grip of the current art trends that we ourselves have discussed on the social networks that play at giving us obligations, orders, digital models to follow in order to be accepted in the game of too much pretty and sexy.

The Form Of The Techno is the reflection of a societal order where the individual is no longer master of himself but intimately subject to the performance of "to be pretty and sexy". The intention is to reflect something different that also separates from a schema of utopian narrative stories for example "Freheit Und Freiheit" or the paintings invite us to enter a naive world, with prudish colors. This new project is a call for the destruction of our digital heritage where all new rules are visible.

The Form of The Techno is a project that casts light on techno music. It depicts scenes from digital heritage in a metaphoric way mixing cerebral landscapes and organic forms, sensual colored patterns with black and dripping shapes. 

Resembling infections of plants and 3D sculptures, atoms or anatomical limbs, this project expands on current trends in contemporary art and on the obligations, orders and digital models to be followed to be accepted in the game.

It is massive, aggressive with brilliant contrasts, with techno music as its only direction and the importance that its auditory aspect can have on the repercussions of the painted gestures. It is a kind of auditory and real experimentation that adapts its design, colors and movements to the modifications induced by sounds.
