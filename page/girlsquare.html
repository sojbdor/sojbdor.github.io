about GIRL SQUARE
"Life is a Surprise" Caf√© Society, Woody Allen

The intention is to make a cult web serie, accessible to everyone, sprinkled with supernatural phenomenes. Beyond the quote, the series can be thought as a metaphor of the 2000's, and of course the arrival of digital technologies in our lives. It is a vulgar copy of Charmed, Totally Spies,mixed with an aestetic who comes from the famous bd 'Apocalypse sur Carson City' written by Griffon. Nothing more extraordinary than ordinary. How do we know that reality isn't a vast illusion? Between science-fiction action and reality. The serie invites you to free yourself from the complex cinema of today. To quietly tackle the themes of everyday lifes and to violate it head-on. A true women revolution "Girl Square" will surprise your expectations.

Genre & Identity
Girl Square brings together characters who are essentially female, ambitious girls who care about their future. Coming from all over the world. Always pimped out, the series prefers chatter to the heroism of the spectacular movies with a lot of 3D. Characters take up dresscode of the American Pop Culture. The serie confronts the search for individuality in a group.

Romance & Homosexuality
The serie tries in discretion, to address in a sensitive way the homosexual sexual relation of lesbians women a rich trafficker is infatuated with a waitress, stories of exes everywhere. Is it the reality? Gangsters talk about their love relationship instead of taking action. What could be more normal? The L word revisited in a mainstream way.

Language
Girl Square telling stories that have nothing to do with the world of today. The serie is not about politic, war or climate warming. She approaches subjects with an ultra vulgar language that we use in everyday life. she erases complex and specialist dialogues. 

Complex human relationship
If the absence of emotions in some characters is present, it is not the case for all of them. Miss Vapor in Episode 1, speaks throughout the space, as the world comes to an end. Girl Square misleads the spectator voluntarily, and brings him to what he already knows, nothing new, inconsistency, no action. Gangsters talk about their respective lovely lives instead of acting, for their mission.

Plagiarism
A true French James Bond Girl, who tackles the feminine nonsense. In the midst of plots, intrigues and meanness. Girl Square uses a multiplicity of cinematographic references ranging from Scorsese cinema, Clin Eastwood to Tarantino, but by emptying them of their substance. Reactionary the series, is a reinterpretation of American pop culture. Using consumption and the naivety of the characters. It is with humor that the series invites you to spend your entertainment in front of more or less crazy spy gangsters who try to solve dubious missions, who relate witchcraft, or not. Girls Square brightens up the current political morbidity. In Girl Square there is no moral just a good time to spend.
