about...<br><br>
<em>"Life is a Surprise" Caf√© Society, Woody Allen</em><br><br>
The title of the webserie, it's two words who play together like charmed snakes. The intention is to makes a cult web serie, accessible to everyone, sprinkled with supernatural phenomenes. Beyond the quote, the series can be thought as a metaphor of the 2000's. It deal with the arrival of digital technologies in our lives. It is a vulgar copy of Charmed, Totally Spies, Un, Dos, Tres. The webserie use the aestetics of bds like 'Apocalypse on Carson City' written by Griffon like a sort of new language. Nothing more extraordinary than ordinary. How do we know that reality isn't a vast illusion? Between science-fiction and reality. The serie invites you to free yourself from the complex cinema of today in oder to quietly tackle the themes of everyday lifes, like a sense of a perpetually unfolding sequence or actually to plays with mechanisms of visual understanding. The webserie use the tension between reality and familiar symbols virtuals 3D models. A true women revolution "Girl Square" will surprise your expectations.<br><br>
The main topic is gender, identity, homosexuality and queer theory love. Characters are more or less anonymous, they are essentially females who are ambitious, all these people just trying to live their lives and get througt their days and they trying to care about their future. They are coming from all over the world. Always pimped, the serie prefers chatter to the heroism of the spectacular movies of these days. Characters take up dresscode of the American Pop Culture. The serie confronts the search for individuality in a group.<br><br>
It approaches the romance and the homosexuality themes about women. It tries in discretion to address in a sensitive way, how are in reallity the relation between two women who are in love each other. For exemple a rich trafficker is falling in love with a waitress, gangsters are talking about their love relationship, instead of taking action. What could be more normal? I mean, is this really what our lives are about? An... The L word revisited, in a mainstream way, like a fake one<br><br>
It is not about politic, war or climate warming. It approaches subjects with an ultra vulgar technical language in oder to make a reference to our the langage that we use in everyday life on internet, it erases complex and specialist dialogues. 
If the absence of emotions in some characters is present, it is not the case for all of them. Miss Vapor in Episode 1, speaks throughout the space, as the world comes to an end. Girl Square misleads the spectator voluntarily and brings him to what he already knows, nothing new, inconsistency, no action. Gangsters talk about their respective lovely lives instead of acting, for their mission.<br><br>
A true French James Bond Girl. In the midst of plots and intrigues. Girl Square uses a multiplicity of cinematographic references ranging from Scorsese, Clin Eastwood to Tarantino cinema, but by emptying them of their substance. Using consumption and the naivety of the characters it is with humor that the serie invites you to spend your time in front of more or less crazy spy gangsters who relate witchcraft, or not. Girls Square brightens up the current political morbidity, there is no moral just a good time to spend.<br><br>
