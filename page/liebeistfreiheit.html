<blockquote>
<em>I am not a new media artist, not a post-internet one, I don’t even understand what ‘post-internet’ means. I am many things, Lu Yan</em><br><br>
Sojbdor’s paintins mixes subjects as lgbtqi, human being, cinema, game, magic, science, religion, philosophy, biology and cyber culture. It reminds us our human foolishness and our fragile existence, but with an edge of dark humor that leaves a room for love and fun.</blockquote>

<em>Paintings that predict things, I often end up analysing my work after having made it, because what I make intuitively can end up much more meaningful than I originally realise while doing it, Akihiko Tanaguichi</em><br><br>
She says <em> drawing is often the beginning of a real situation analysis</em> She feels connected by the human being, the present and nature. She questions herself about the spoken language, written language, body language, which she mixed with different references mythology of the Far East, the celestial hierarchies of the Nordic myths or the Russian art of the last 50 years and our new world. She is inspired by outsider art, popular culture and internet art. 
For every new painting, Charlène Levasseur do some researches. She draws her inspiration from contemporary art books, modern art books, Russian modern art books, fashion photographs, concert photographs and album artworks. Sometimes she inspires herself with her own photographs and drawings, mixed with dinosaurs and animals old books.  All these informations plays the role of models and appears as methods that she try to rework, to rediscover. She creates fictions, sometimes readable, sometimes extremely complex. Much of her artworks strikes a perfect balance between coherence and nonsense.

<blockquote>	
<em>I am more interested in creating worlds, Hilary Harkness</em><br><br>	
In her paintings, she built the form with black color as a labyrinth, as a sort of unknown place with sectorized places. The black shape comes to create a kind of cartography, like the synapses of neurons. Places are all related each other throughout borders. After, she puts colors. She begins to put with the most obscur color then she clear the color with white, which then gives a pure color, raw and solid. This process creates a discontinuous gradient, like a sort of rainbow of liberty. What is it? It representes many inner spaces occupied by sexy cyber punks who are in love each other, smoking cigarets, drinking, swimming, playing music, listening to music, dancing, sometimes together and occasionnally alone.
