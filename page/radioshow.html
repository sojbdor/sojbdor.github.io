Red Carpet Incubator is a sequence of deconstructed jam sessions recorded in a home studio, focuses on exploring and refining advanced techniques for crafting sound textures. These sessions showcase meticulous utilization of audio effects such as distortion, wave folding, VCA, LFO, and innovative production methods to create genuine and groundbreaking sonic textures. The objective is to deviate from the conventional trends in techno music. Each jam session delves deeply into sound manipulation, employing modulation, distortion, granular synthesis, and spatialization effects to craft distinctive and immersive sound textures. These recordings signify an intensive technical exploration, highlighting experimentation in production techniques that range from modular sound synthesis to precise effect programming. The aim is to extend the boundaries of sound creation within the domain of modern techno music.<br>

KRKRKR is a podcast series created by Sukkube during Corona times on Sphere Radio (Leipzig, Germany), with a one-hour episode every month, recorded in my studio during the era of the coronavirus pandemic. This podcast is dedicated to showcasing both new releases and unreleased techno tracks, spanning the spectrum from unfamous productions to experimental sounds. These tracks have been collected over many years of research into the world of experimental techno, rave culture.
Techno has always served as a genuine form of communication for me, a means to found a place in ourself for creativity and care against the forces of neoliberalism and capitalism. The menu of KRKRKR serves as a journey through cerebral soundscapes and fat liquids. This is not your typical electronic music experience; it's a sonic rebellion against the capitalist influences that mold our world. In a society driven by profit, we aim to discover illumination within the shadows. Rather than being a simple dance mix, the radioshow opening a space for reflection and exploration through the intricate depths of this world.
