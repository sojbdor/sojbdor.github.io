KRKRKR is a podcast series on Sphere Radio (Leipzig, Germany), with a one-hour episode every month, recorded in my studio during the era of the coronavirus pandemic. This podcast is dedicated to showcasing both new releases and unreleased techno tracks, spanning the spectrum from unfamous productions to experimental sounds. These tracks have been collected over many years of research into the world of experimental techno, rave culture.
Techno has always served as a genuine form of communication for me, a means to found a place in ourself for creativity and care against the forces of neoliberalism and capitalism. The menu of KRKRKR serves as a journey through cerebral soundscapes and fat liquids. This is not your typical electronic music experience; it's a sonic rebellion against the capitalist influences that mold our world.
In a society driven by profit, we aim to discover illumination within the shadows. Rather than being a simple dance mix, the radioshow opening a space for reflection and exploration through the intricate depths of this world.
