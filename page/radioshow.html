<big><b>Red Carpet Incubator</b>, Modular research, jam research</big><br><br>
Red Carpet Incubator is a sequence of deconstructed jam sessions recorded in a home studio, focuses on exploring and refining advanced techniques for crafting sound textures. These sessions showcase meticulous utilization of audio effects such as distortion, wave folding, VCA, LFO, and innovative production methods to create genuine and groundbreaking sonic textures. The objective is to deviate from the conventional trends in techno music. Each jam session delves deeply into sound manipulation, employing modulation, distortion, granular synthesis, and spatialization effects to craft distinctive and immersive sound textures. These recordings signify an intensive technical exploration, highlighting experimentation in production techniques that range from modular sound synthesis to precise effect programming. The aim is to extend the boundaries of sound creation within the domain of modern techno music.</div>

<big><b>KRKRKR</b>, Podcast series, live and dj stuffs</big><br><br>
KRKRKR is a podcast series created by Sukkube during Corona times on Sphere Radio (Leipzig, Germany), with a one-hour episode every month, recorded in my studio during the era of the coronavirus pandemic. This podcast is dedicated to showcasing both new releases and unreleased techno tracks, spanning the spectrum from unfamous productions to experimental sounds. These tracks have been collected over many years of research into the world of experimental techno, rave culture.
Techno has always served as a genuine form of communication for me, a means to found a place in ourself for creativity and care against the forces of neoliberalism and capitalism. The menu of KRKRKR serves as a journey through cerebral soundscapes and fat liquids. This is not your typical electronic music experience; it's a sonic rebellion against the capitalist influences that mold our world. In a society driven by profit, we aim to discover illumination within the shadows. Rather than being a simple dance mix, the radioshow opening a space for reflection and exploration through the intricate depths of this world.</div>

<big><b>Sans Blabla</b>, Radio show, dj stuff</big><br><br>

Sojbdor was the first entity of Sukkube. Experimental house music to techno. Once a month on Sundays at 10:00 PM, here's the story of an asexual robot named Sojbdor. No one truly knows which planet Sojbdor hails from. He doesn't speak often, generally having nothing to say. This robot prefers to stroll, walk, and enjoy raspberries, an activity he cherishes and engages in almost every day. When he wanders alone, Sojbdor takes his headphones to listen to music while exploring the world, whether it's on a bike, skateboard, or scooter. He gets so absorbed in the music that sometimes he loses track of his surroundings. He might find himself lost in thoughts, dancing alone, whether it's on the street, at home, or even at work.<br>
Be it a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, or any other day, Sojbdor heads to clubs to listen to his favorite artists. He leans towards contemporary techno, hard-techno, dub-techno, modern techno, groovy, and experimental sounds, although he occasionally enjoys ambient, rock, metal, hip-hop, or rap. He realized that music transports him into the future, yet it also depends on his moods because sometimes it stirs up feelings of nostalgia in him. Sojbdor isn't sure if he decides to feel nostalgic himself or if it's the music that inspires this sentiment in him. 2020-2021, Sojbdor presents music on Campus FM. You never really know what he will introduce you to.</div>

<big><b>Unikradioshow</br></b>, Live on modular at Campus FM</big><br><br>
Sukkube perform one hour of live, showcase in Campus Radio Toulouse, a live show involving modular synthesizers, a dark ambient show is an immersive and often intense sensory experience characterized by dark, ethereal, and sometimes oppressive soundscapes, immersive and dynamic experience.. Show filmed by El Pintor.<br>
About Unikradioshow it is hspecially music, voices, and effects while following a unique theme. Comprised of multiple sources (musical, literary, cinematic) that are dissected, overlaid, and sometimes manipulated to the very limits of sound nature, the montage creates a compact, coherent whole tied together by the chosen guiding thread. The themes covered exhaustively include the discography of a label, an audio interpretation of a comic book or movie, an original composition, a focus on a music style or film director, showcasing an artist, or simply a mix. Unikradioshow oscillates between auditory illustration and musical experience, like a chemist and their formula. 'If we are made of the same material as dreams, each episode comes from a dream, due to this musical flesh with spectral resonance. Stepping into this music is akin to diving both feet into a long and profound meditation, with, at the end of the experience, a feeling of having penetrated a part of reality that was mischievously concealed.'Hauntology Sound & Music Research. Musical thematic broadcast (Hiphop Rock Psyche Electro House Experimental Techno Future Bass Footwork Juke Wonky Soul Funk Global Groove Deep Disco Boogie). A program by David Deuce airing three Tuesdays per month at 8:00 PM on Campus FM.</div>
