The Form Of The Techno is massive, aggressive and violent. Written with techno in mind, it shows the importance of the auditory experience because of its repercussions on the painted gestures. It is a kind of real-time auditory experimentation by which design, colors and movements adapt to and are changed by sounds.<br><br>
It depicts scenes from digital heritage in a metaphoric way, mixing landscapes, organic forms, dirty textures, sensual colored patterns. Resembling body infections, 3D sculptures, atoms or anatomical limbs.

Charlene uses fashion photographs and preparatory drawings as a starter for painting. Inspired by her friends and characters of her entourage, she introduced them in sectorized and colored spaces. They are recognizable by their dress code, their gestural position. You never really know who is it. What seems to be chaotic in forms is actually a structure ordered, a collection of forms where every forms has its proper space. The color is diluted with water and mixing with white or black, to get the more intense color, more clear or more dark then it gives a pure color, raw, solid, opaque. The black outlines separate colors and characters and create a kind of cartography. <br><br>
« Charlène, Juliette Maryline, Sojbdor, Sukkube, question herself as much on the spoken language, as the language of the body or that of the new technologies, which she assemble with various references like the mythology of the Far East, the celestial hierarchies of the Nordic myths or the Russian art of the last 50 years. <br><br>
For her the drawing is the beginning of a situation analysis which often comes from reality. To remain in the flow is to remain in the present and to renew oneself by appropriating contemporary cultural practices to reproduce a new message in it. <br><br>
Inspired by modern art and popular art in general, she makes her own signs that belong to all humanity. Painting is above all a bearer of ideas and technical and practical experiences. How can representations and experiences be artistically transposed? What aesthetic and iconic ideas are developed? These experiences are stored in her brain, they influence the process of her work. 
Outsider art, impressionist, expressionist, cubist, abstract, minimalist, contemporary art are sets of information that have a model function and appear as methods that she tries to rework, to rediscover. She creates fictions. »<br>
Interview : N°14 place à..., 2018, Texts written by Johana Carrier and Marine Pagès founder of Roven<br><br>

Paintings can talk about stars in Cannes during the global warming. Peoples exchange of information about their last Versace brand purchase, veganism, the end of the world. A girl can be under the rain with an umbrella in the middle of nowhere. Cruella D’enfer can cut the tweed-trousers of a person randomly.<br><br>
Cemetery’s Night in Glasgow, Is a story of a trip in Scotland between two girls in love. A man can throws magic spells on the city while the background is melting. It draws a plural ballad in the Scottish depths, you will find some fat kicks with reasoning lubricant. With style on flying toast of robotic post rock, the jungle will lead this galactic fleet in the psychochaotic woes. It must be a cake with lots of whipped cream sprinkled with poorly explained classics. <br><br>
In She Likes Sport Picture, you can find many inner spaces, occupied by sexy cyberpunk, scary girls and boys robots. From time to time they are swimming, playing, dancing, drinking, smoking cigarette, listening to music, together or occasionally alone. In this serie you can see animal, towns and landscapes taken from fantasy and subculture wild world.
