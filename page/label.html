<big><b>Nuages De Feu</b></big><br><br>
The 4th production of the Associated Paraboloid label, Nuages de Feu, is a compilation in which incandescent sounds take off in the altostratus. The frequencies shine, saturate, consume, and generate nimbustorsions and will-o'-the-wisps. The samples jostle and warm up with a passion to burn the waves. The kicks blaze, the snares corrode, the hi-hats sparkle, and the melodies are both fiery and toxic. The combustion of the drums generates smog and pyrocumulus, then reaches its climax with asphyxiation<br><br>

<big><b>Vent Noir</b></big><br><br>
This compilation is an ode to hard techno. The kicks are round, circular and regular, they get carried away, distorted and damaged, the snares are scathing, the atmospheric layers reverberate. The signals are pushed to their maximum amplitude until saturation. The timbres shift and are re-injected in an infusion of black noise. The echoes, expelled from the field, pursue their own rhythms and experiment at random with their courses, some running out of steam in their intentions and others, over the course of the measures, improvising dissident rhythms while pursuing a centripetal acceleration, carried by the wind and always directed towards the centre<br><br>

<big><b>Halber Spin</b></big><br><br>
Associated Paraboloid's first release ’Halber Spin’, featuring producers from France, Germany, and Russia. Beennooutside, .287, Jaquarius, Sukkube, Spatiosselet, Halosaur, Armando, Roma Zuckerman, Jessica Kert have composed this physical and digital release around the word 'Techno'. This is a mathematical compilation. Every sound is a part of a global paraboloid shape. This is an open surface. Micro-sounds turning and flowing in an hyperbolic way which gives the sensation of a glide on an effervescent atmosphere. Different surfaces are associated with a metronomic regularity, which cuts the temporal space in several perpendicular axis. Edition limited of tapes with some tracks bonus of Jaquarius.<br><br>
