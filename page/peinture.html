Liebe Ist Freiheit
Sojbdor paint her friends, characters of my entourage in sectorized and
colored spaces. They are recognizable by their dresscode or their
gestural position. You never really know who is it. The serie is actually in the progress, it is a group of nine paintings, it introduce
characters, animals, towns, landscapes from fantasy wild world, reality and nature. There are many inner spaces, occupied by sexy cyber
punks wich are smoking cigarets, swimming, playing music, listening
to music, dancing, drinking, sometimes together, occasionnaly alone.<br>
For example:<br>
Paintings can talks about stars in Cannes Film Festival during the global warming.
Peoples talk about their last Versace brand purchase, one of them is
vegan but she does not support it.<br>
A girl is under the rain with an broken umbrella in the middle of a dystopian world. She gets the rain on her. She has magical powers,
she throws balls of fire and electricity not throught Cruella D’enfer, the other woman who wearing tweed pants and holding a comb in her hand. She watches a girl playing sports, by the leash.
tweed-trousers of an other girl, who loves sport.<br>
A story of a trip in Scotland between two peoples in love. A man without a face throws magic spells on the city while the background is
melting.<br>
It draws a plural ballad in the Soviet depths, you will find some fat
kicks with reasoning lubricant. With style on flying toast of robotic
post rock, the jungle will lead this galactic fleet in the psychocaotic woes.
It must be a cake with lots of whipped cream sprinkled with poorly
recorded classics.
