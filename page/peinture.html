<h3>Liebe Ist Freiheit</h3><br><br>	
<em>I am not a new media artist, not a
post-internet one, I don’t even unders- tand what ‘post-internet’ means. I am many things" Lu Yang</em><br><br>
Sojbdor work mixes subjects as lgbtqi, human being,
cinema, game, magic, science, religion, philosophy,
biology and cyber culture. It reminds us our human
foolishness and our fragile existence, but with an
edge of dark humor that leaves a room for love and
fun.<br><br>
	
<em>Paintings that predict things, I often end up analysing my work after having made it, because what I make intuitively
can end up much more meaningful than I originally realise while doing it. Akihiko Tanaguichi</em><br><br>
	
She spends all her time to paint, make videos, product musics and installations. She feels connected by the human being, the present and nature.
She questions herself about the spoken language, written language, body language and new technonology language, which she mixed with different
references mythology of the Far East, the celestial hierarchies of the Nordic myths or the Russian art of the last 50 years.
Drawing is often the beginning of a real situation analysis. She is inspired by outsider art, popular culture, and internet art, these informations plays
the role of models and appears as methods that she try to rework, to rediscover. She creates fictions, sometimes readable, sometimes extremely
complex. Much of her artworks strikes a perfect balance between coherence and nonsense.<br><br>	
	
	
<em>I personally am more interested in creating worlds , Hilary Harkness</em><br><br>
	
For every new painting, Charlène Levasseur do some researches. She draws her inspiration from contemporary art books, modern
art books, Russian modern art books, fashion photographs, concert photographs and album artworks. Sometimes she inspires herself
with her own photographs and drawings, mixed with dinosaurs and animals old books.
In her paintings, she built the form with black color as a labyrinth, as a sort of unknown place with sectorized places. The black shape
comes to create a kind of cartography, like the synapses of neurons, places are all related each other throughout borders.
After, she puts colors. She begins to put with the most dark color then she clear the color with white, which then gives a pure color,
raw, solid, opaque and clear. This process creates a discontinuous gradient, like a sort of rainbow of liberty.
Sometimes it representes many inner spaces, occupied by sexy cyber woman punks who are in love, smoking cigarets, swimming,
playing music, listening to music, dancing, drinking, sometimes together, occasionnally alone.<br><br>
	

For example:<br><br>
Paintings can talks about stars in Cannes Film Festival during the global warming.
Peoples talk about their last Versace brand purchase, one of them is
vegan but she does not support it.<br>
A girl is under the rain with an broken umbrella in the middle of a dystopian world. She gets the rain on her. She has magical powers,
she throws balls of fire and electricity not throught Cruella D’enfer, the other woman who wearing tweed pants and holding a comb in her hand. She watches a girl playing sports, by the leash.
tweed-trousers of an other girl, who loves sport.<br>
A story of a trip in Scotland between two peoples in love. A man without a face throws magic spells on the city while the background is
melting. It draws a plural ballad in the Soviet depths, you will find some fat
kicks with reasoning lubricant. With style on flying toast of robotic
post rock, the jungle will lead this galactic fleet in the psychocaotic woes.
It must be a cake with lots of whipped cream sprinkled with poorly
recorded classics.
