This serie is called «Liebe Ist Freiheit», this serie is in progress all over the time. In this paintings when can discover many inner spaces, layers, occupied by sexy cyberpunks and scary girls and robots. From time to time there are smoking cigarets, swimming, playing, dancing, drinking, listening to music, sometimes together, occasionnaly all alone. This paintings introduce animals characters, towns and landscapes inspired fantasy wild and cold world.<blockquote/><br>	
<blockquote>Sometimes used insiprations from United-Kingdom particulary the architecture of Edimbourg, in Scotland, or other country in Europe. At first figurative, I paint characters of my entourage in sectorized and colored spaces. There are robotic characters. They are friends, who are recognizable by their word, or by their dresscode or gestural position, you'll never know who they are unless you know them :) A faceless man casts magical spells on the city as the decorations melt away. Sometimes when can see two stars who meet out Cannes Film Festival during the global warming caracters talk about their last Versace brand purchase, one of them is vegan but she does not support it. Looking away when can discover a girl who is under the rain with an umbrella pierced in a middle of a dystopian world. She gets the rain on her. She has magical powers too, she throws balls of fire and electricity. Another woman with the Cruella D’enfer cup holds a tweed then a girl who loves sport by the leash.</blockquote><br><br>
